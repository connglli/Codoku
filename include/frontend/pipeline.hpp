// Turning RefractIR source text into a program that is safe to run, compile or
// solve.
//
// Every consumer of a `.sir` file takes the same two steps: lex and parse the
// text into a `Program`, then run the checks that establish the invariants the
// interpreter, the backends and the symbolic executor all assume. That shape
// is fixed, and this header owns it, so a check added here reaches every
// consumer instead of the ones that remembered to list it.
//
// The checks are ordered. `SemChecker` and `TypeChecker` run over the whole
// module first, because per-function analysis of a program that is not
// well-formed means nothing, and because the later passes read the types the
// type checker assigns. The function analyses then run over each function in
// turn. `CheckOptions` selects which of them apply.
//
// Diagnostics stay with the caller. `checkProgram` fills a `DiagBag` and
// answers whether the program is well-formed; rendering a diagnostic needs the
// source text and a choice of format, and neither belongs to the checking.
