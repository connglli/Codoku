// Driving a backend end to end: check the program, pick the lowering, write
// the file.
//
// Every backend is configured the same way — the same flags in the same order,
// the same reducibility precondition when control flow is reconstructed, the
// same vector-lowering choice — and the sequence is easy to get subtly wrong
// one caller at a time. This header owns it, so a backend that grows a knob
// grows it once here and every caller has it.
//
// The functions report success or failure and write nothing to any stream but
// the output file. What a failure should say, and to whom, is the caller's:
// a command-line tool prints it, an embedding counts it. Pass `verbose` to get
// a one-line reason on stderr while diagnosing.
