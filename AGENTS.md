# RefractIR: Agent Guideline

+ Knowledge Background: Optimizing Compilers, Program Analysis, Symbolic Execution, SMT (Bit-Vector Theory)
+ Implementation Language: C++ 20
+ Primary Source Directory: ./src


## Project Overview

RefractIR (internally called SymIR) is a **CFG-based symbolic intermediate representation** designed for:

- **Program synthesis**
- **Symbolic execution**
- **Constraint generation for SMT solvers (Bit-Vector logic)**

A RefractIR program is a **template**, not a fully concrete program. It may contain **symbols** (unknowns, marked with `?`) whose values are solved later by an SMT solver under constraints derived from:

1. A **specific execution path** through the CFG
2. Explicit **properties** (e.g., `require` and/or other user-provided properties) that must hold on that path

The key design goals are:

- SMT-friendliness (predictable BV constraints, minimal nonlinearity)
- Clear semantics with **strict undefined behavior (UB)**
- Explicit control-flow (CFG, no SSA, user-friendly)
- Simplicity and analyzability over expressiveness

RefractIR deliberately restricts expressions (flat, left-to-right, no parentheses) and uses **LLVM-style syntax** (`@`, `%`, `br`, basic blocks) while remaining language-agnostic.

The normative specification is **[./docs/SPEC_v0.2.3.md](./docs/SPEC_v0.2.3.md)**, which doubles as the release roadmap and marks each feature **[Shipped]** or **[Planned]**. Earlier specs are kept as they shipped; [./README.md](./README.md) indexes them, and [./CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) records what each release added.

## Language at a Glance

Key characteristics:

- **Non-SSA**, mutable locals via `let mut`
- **Symbols**: solver-chosen unknowns (`@?x`, `%?y`)
- **CFG-based**: explicit basic blocks (`^label`)
- **Expressions**:
  - Flat, left-to-right
  - `+`, `-` at expression level
  - `*`, `/`, `%` at atom level
- **Division/modulo**: round toward 0 (C / SMT `bvsdiv`, `bvsrem`)
- **select** expression:
  - Lazy (only selected arm evaluated)
  - Expression-level conditional; mask-based `select <N> i1` for per-lane blends (v0.2.1)
- **Floating-point**:
  - `f32` (IEEE 754 single) and `f64` (IEEE 754 double)
  - Finite-only domain: ±∞ and NaN are UB
  - `%` is C's `fmod` (truncated-quotient remainder)
  - All operations use RNE rounding
- **Pointers (v0.2.0)**:
  - `ptr T` type, scalar/pointer pointees
  - `addr lv` produces `ptr T` (requires `let mut` root)
  - `load p`, `store p, v` for read/write through pointers
  - `null` literal (typed by context)
  - Pointer arithmetic: `ptr T ± iN → ptr T`, `ptr T - ptr T → i64` (element distance)
  - No `sym` of pointer or aggregate (array/struct) type; no pointer/integer casts
- **Aggregate pointers (v0.2.1)**:
  - `ptr [N] T` / `ptr @S` — pointers to arrays and structs
  - `ptrindex <ptr [N] T>, <idx>` → `ptr T` (navigate array element)
  - `ptrfield <ptr @S>, <field>` → `ptr FieldType` (navigate struct field)
  - Packed `sizeof(@S) = Σ sizeof(field_i)`; no padding
  - No aggregate `load`/`store`; navigate to scalar/pointer leaves first
- **Vector types (v0.2.1)**:
  - `<N> T` — fixed-width SIMD vector of scalar elements
  - Lane-wise arithmetic: all scalar operators lift to vectors
  - `cmp <relop> lhs, rhs` — reified comparison → `i1` (scalar) or `<N> i1` (vector mask)
  - Lane access via subscript: `%v[%i]` reads/writes lane `i`
  - Whole-vector copy: `%v = %w;`
  - Not addressable: no `ptr <N> T`, no `addr` on vector locals
  - `sym` of vector type allowed (per-lane independent symbols)
- **Strict UB**:
  - Division/modulo by zero
  - Out-of-bounds array access
  - Reading `undef`
  - Null/uninitialised/out-of-bounds pointer dereference, cross-object pointer arithmetic or relational comparison
  - FP overflow/NaN, float-to-integer out-of-range
  - Vector lane-wise UB, out-of-bounds lane access (v0.2.1)

## Toolchain Overview

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `symirc` | Translate `.sir` to C / WebAssembly / Python |
| `symiri` | Interpret `.sir` programs |
| `symirsolve` | Concretize symbolic programs using SMT |
| `rysmith` | Generate random RefractIR leaf functions (reify) |
| `rylink` | Compose leaf functions into whole programs (reify) |
| `rytwin` | Transform a generated program into a semantically-equivalent variant (reify) |
| `rypuzmk` / `rypuzchk` | Make / check fill-in-the-blanks puzzles (see [./docs/puzzle.md](./docs/puzzle.md)) |

Documentation of each tool: [./docs/](./docs).

Remember: The interpreter, solver, and compiler backends are shared foundational for **all** RefractIR tooling. They should be kept **clean, correct, and well-tested**. They should also be kept **independent of any specific downstream tools**, with mentioning none in their implementation.

### Puzzle tooling (`rypuzmk` / `rypuzchk`)

The puzzle tools live in [`./puzzle/`](./puzzle) and share
[`puzzle/puzzle_common.hpp`](./puzzle/puzzle_common.hpp) (the masking printer,
the `MaskedConstantCollector`, and helpers). `rypuzmk` masks a rysmith-generated
leaf into `FILL_XXX` blanks with a machine-readable banner; `rypuzchk` validates
a solution (correctness via the embedded `check_chksum`, plus path, FILL_CONST
budget, intrinsic usage, and a re-mask structural check). The puzzle/checker
contract and its intended degrees of freedom are documented in
[./docs/puzzle.md](./docs/puzzle.md) — read it before changing the masking model
or either tool, because the producer and consumer must stay in lockstep.

```

### 1. Lexer
- Converts source text into tokens
- Handles identifiers with sigils (`@`, `%`, `@?`, `%?`, `^`)
- Handles comments and string literals
- No semantic knowledge

### 2. Parser
- Recursive-descent parser
- Builds a **typed, structured AST**
- Preserves source spans for diagnostics
- AST is analysis-oriented (not syntax-oriented)

### 3. CFG Builder
- Indexes basic blocks by label
- Builds successor and predecessor lists
- Validates `br` targets
- Computes traversal orders (e.g., reverse postorder)
- Forms the backbone for all dataflow analyses

### 4. TypeChecker (BV-aware)
- Maps RefractIR integer types to **SMT bit-vectors**
  - `i32` → `(_ BitVec 32)`
  - `i64` → `(_ BitVec 64)`
  - `iN`  → `(_ BitVec N)`
- Ensures:
  - Type correctness of expressions
  - Bitwidth compatibility
  - Correct typing of `select`
  - Assignment compatibility
  - Function return correctness
- Produces **typed annotations** for AST nodes
- Boolean conditions are treated separately from BV integers

### 5. Semantic Checker
Ensures program well-formedness beyond typing:

- Variables and symbols are declared before use
- No duplicate declarations
- Assignment only to `let mut` locals
- Parameters and symbols are immutable
- Definite initialization:
  - Parameters are initialized
  - `undef` is uninitialized
  - Reads before initialization are errors
- CFG consistency checks

### 6. Symbolic Execution / Constraint Generation

- Executes along a **user-selected path** (in `symirsolve` / SMT solver backend)
- Collects:
  - Path conditions from branches
  - Assumptions (`assume`)
  - Required properties (`require`)
- Applies **strict UB pruning**
- Produces BV and FP constraints suitable for SMT solvers (Bitwuzla/Z3)

### 7. Language Lower / Translator
- Translate a symbolic or concrete program into an existing language
- First-class support are C, WebAssembly, and Python.
- The Python target accepts only **reducible** CFGs and reconstructs genuine `while`/`if` control flow (dominator tree → reducibility check → loop forest → control tree → structured lowering; see [./docs/reducibility.md](./docs/reducibility.md)). The C backend emits labels+goto by default and offers the same structured reconstruction (`while`/`do-while`/`if`) behind `--structured-lowering`; the WASM backend emits a `$__pc`/`br_table` dispatch loop by default and, under `--structured-lowering`, reconstructs `block`/`loop`/`if` from the *unlowered* control tree using WASM's native multi-level `br`.
- For symbolic program translation, use external function declarations to indicate symbols.
  - C: `extern int func_name_symbol_name(...);`
  - WASM: `import func_name symbol_name (func func_name_symbol_name (....))`
  - Python: `func_name__symbol_name()` provider calls injected into module globals by the embedding

Goto [./README.md](./README.md)


## Testing – TDD Approach (MANDATORY)

ALWAYS follow a strict Test-Driven Development discipline.

### Required workflow

1. Write **five failing tests** that expose the bug or demonstrate the desired behavior
2. Run the tests **one by one** to confirm they fail
3. Implement the fix or feature
4. Run the tests **one by one** to confirm they pass
5. Add the **smallest additional test** that covers edge cases, in the correct test directory

### Never

1. Disable failing tests
2. Modify tests to avoid triggering bugs
3. Add workarounds that bypass the real issue
4. Implement features without a test demonstrating them first

### How to Run Tests

The test suite is managed via the `Makefile` targets:

- `make test`: Runs the entire test suite sequentially.
- `make test-unit`: Runs unit tests for command-line arguments and reification pipelines.
- `make test-frontend`: Runs frontend validation tests (lexer, parser, type checker, semantic checker) using `symiri --check`, and CFG reducibility tests (dominator trees, loops, control trees) against `.sir.expected` files.
- `make test-interp`: Runs reference interpreter execution tests without checking mode.
- `make test-backends`: Runs compiler backend compilation and execution tests for C (goto and --structured-lowering modes), WASM, and Python targets.
- `make cross-validation`: Cross-validates interpreter execution outputs and UB behavior against compiled C binaries, in both goto and structured-lowering emission modes.
- `make test-solver`: Runs symbolic execution and SMT constraint solver tests.
- `make test-reify`: Runs differential random generation testing for rysmith and rylink.

## Dependency Management

### C++
- Dependencies are managed **manually**
- Prefer header-only or standard-library-only solutions
- When introducing a new dependency:
  - Update `README.md`
  - Clearly document installation steps and versions

### Python (if used for tooling)
- Virtual environment: `./venv`
- Activate with:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ````

* Dependencies:
  * `requirements.txt` – runtime
  * `requirements.dev.txt` – development
* Always pin exact versions

## Principles and Best Practices

Always follow good practices:

1. Use git frequently and meaningfully
2. Follow **Conventional Commits**
3. Keep `README.md`, the current `docs/SPEC_v*.md`, and this file up to date
4. Fix **all compiler warnings**
5. Keep a clean, layered project structure
6. Write high-quality comments that explain *why*, not *what*
7. Comments describe the current state, not the change history, unless it is a bugfix or a workaround for a critical known issue
8. Keep functions small, shallow, and focused on a single responsibility
9. Keep CHANGELOG concise (multiple related entries can be summarized in one line)
10. Follow [./docs/AGENTS.md](./docs/AGENTS.md) when writing documents, header comments, or anything else durable in prose

Always check whether a design/implementation is *elegant*:

(1) It retains a minimalist core and a clean conceptual model.
(2) It is simple enough that an experienced developer can understand it within five minutes without any explanation.

Always keep in mind the following principles to make it elegant before designing any new feature or changing existing behavior. Consider these principles, think twice, and then design:

1. KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Is this the simplest design that works?
2. SINE: Simplicity Is Not Enough. Is this design analyzable, testable, and solver-friendly?
3. DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. Are there existing abstractions/implementations that can be reused?
4. YAGNI: You Ain't Gonna Need It. Do we really need this feature now, or is it speculative?
5. SOLID: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion. Does this design adhere to these principles?

## Floating-point serialization invariant (MANDATORY)

RefractIR carries `f32`/`f64` values bit-exactly across **every** text boundary. One canonical format, one canonical parser, used everywhere RefractIR text crosses a process or file boundary:

- **`refractir::formatDouble(double)`** to emit.
- **`refractir::parseFloatLiteral(std::string)`** to parse. **Never `std::stod`**: libstdc++ throws `out_of_range` on any `ERANGE`, valid subnormals included, so a representable denormal would abort the interpreter.

Before writing `std::stod`, `std::stof`, `std::atof`, `std::to_string(double)`, `std::cout << double_value`, an `std::ostringstream` with `precision(17)`, or `printf("%f"/"%g", …)` anywhere in RefractIR, stop and use the canonical pair.

[./docs/float.md](./docs/float.md) §9 owns this invariant: which sites it covers, where the backends intentionally diverge (C and WAT float grammar), why `printf("%a", …)` is the one accepted exception, and how it extends to the SMT boundary.

## Before Starting Work

1. Review recent history:

   ```bash
   git log [--oneline] [--stat] [--name-only] # Show brief/extended history
   git show [--summary] [--stat] [--name-only] <commit> # Show brief/extended history of a commit
   git diff <commit> <commit> # Compare two different commits
   git checkout <commit> # Checkout and inspect all the details of a commit
   ```
2. Understand existing design decisions before changing behavior
3. For large tasks, commit incrementally with clear messages

## Before Saving Changes

ALWAYS:

1. Clear all compiler warnings
2. Format code with `clang-format`
3. Ensure all tests pass (timeouts excepted)
4. Check changes with `git status`
5. Split work into small, reviewable commits
6. Ask the user to review your changes before committing
7. Use Conventional Commit messages:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <title>

<body>

[optional footer]
```

* Title ≤ 50 characters
* Body explains intent and design impact

**Remember:**
RefractIR prioritizes *clarity, analyzability, and solver-friendliness* over surface-level convenience.
Preserve these properties in every change.
